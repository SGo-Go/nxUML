nxUML
--------------------------------
**Purpose:** 
nxUML is a simple and extensible Python package 
for parsing source codes into extended networkx.MultiGraph object
which represents UML class diagrams.
nxUML provides easily tunable plotting facilities.

Currently only C++ sources are supported.
It can be easily used as an extension to Doxygen
for tunable generating collaboration diagrams.

TODO list (urgent):
* extended support of qualifiers and templated classes
* parser for Python codes, as well as UFX and XMI files
* export to UFX and XMI
